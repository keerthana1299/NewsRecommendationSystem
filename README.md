# News Article Recommendation System
This project aims to create a recommendation system that would predict or filter preferences according to the user’s choices. The goal is to recommend news articles which are similar to the already read article by using attributes like article headline, category, author and publishing date. The method
of implementation is that of a content-based recommendation system, which recommends items based on the user’s past preferences. Two methods of content filtering are implemented and their results are compared.
